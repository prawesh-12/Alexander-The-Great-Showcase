                <h2>Summary of Alexander the Great</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE) was the king of Macedon and one of history’s most renowned
                    military commanders.
                    Born in Pella to King Philip II and Queen Olympias, he was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle, who
                    instilled in him a love for knowledge and a passion for conquest.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    After ascending the throne at the age of 20 following his father’s assassination, Alexander quickly
                    consolidated power over Greece and launched a campaign against the mighty Persian Empire.
                    His extraordinary military tactics led to decisive victories in battles such as Granicus, Issus, and
                    Gaugamela, which ultimately resulted in the fall of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Alexander’s conquests continued as he advanced into Egypt, where he was welcomed as a liberator and
                    crowned Pharaoh.
                    Pushing further east, he crossed into India and won a significant battle against King Porus at the
                    Hydaspes River.
                    However, his troops, exhausted and longing to return home, refused to march further, bringing his
                    expansion to a halt.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    By the time of his death at just 32 years old, Alexander had created one of the largest empires of
                    the ancient world, stretching from Greece all the way to northwestern India.
                    His legacy is marked by the spread of Hellenistic culture, the founding of cities such as
                    Alexandria, and the fusion of Greek and Eastern customs, which influenced art, architecture,
                    language, and governance for centuries.
